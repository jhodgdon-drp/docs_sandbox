== State API

The State API provides a place for developers to store information about the
system's state. A good example of state is the last time cron was run. This is
specific to an environment and has no use in deployment.  See
<<config_info_types>> for a more complete discussion of how state information
differs from configuration information.

The State API is a simple system to store this information. Typical usage:

[source,php]
----
// Get a value:
$val = Drupal::state()->get('key');
// Get multiple key/value pairs:
$pairs = Drupal::state()->getMultiple($keys);
// Get all key/value pairs:
$collection = Drupal::state()->getAll();
// Set a value:
Drupal::state()->set('key','value');
// Set multiple values:
Drupal::state()->setMultiple($keyvalues);
// Set a value if not already set:
Drupal::state()->setIfNotExists('key','value');
// Delete a value:
Drupal::state()->delete('key');
----
