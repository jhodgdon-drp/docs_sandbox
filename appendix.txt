[[style-guide]]
=== Formatting and Style Guide

The documentation in this project is formatted using
http://asciidoc.org[AsciiDoc], which is a fairly simple markdown-style
syntax. The
http://asciidoc.org/userguide.html[AsciiDoc user guide] explains the markup
syntax in detail. Or, you can use this handy
http://powerman.name/doc/asciidoc[AsciiDoc Cheat Sheet].

A few notes on syntax that are specific to Drupal Core documentation follow.

Oh hai from beejeebus.

[[style-sections]]
==== Chapters and Sections

AsciiDoc supports a couple of different syntax options for chapters and
sections; we're using an alternative that is not covered in all AsciiDoc
documentation, but is simpler to use.

Also, every section and chapter should have an identifier on it.

So, it looks like this:

----
 = Overall Book Title
 
 another test 

 [[first_chapter_id]]
 == Chapter Title One

 [[first_section_id]]
 === Section Title Sub 1
----

You can then make a link to a different chapter or section by putting

----
 <<the_id>>
----

into your text.

Each chapter should be in a separate file; sections can be in the same file or
separate files. Chapters are things like "Configuration API" and sections
roughly correspond to drupal.org book pages within each chapter. On
api.drupal.org, each section will be displayed on its own page.

[[style-code]]
==== Code

To include PHP code, prefix a literal block (which starts with +----+ on its own
line) with +[source,php]+. Other types of source code are also recognized, such
as +css+, +javascript+, +sql+, +html+, etc. For generic source code, you can
omit the +[source,php]+ line. There are examples in most of the files.

[[style-versions]]
==== Drupal Versions

This repository will be branched for new versions of Drupal. So, do not
specifically use the version number in your writing, except in the top-level
book title, and in specific sections about updating from one version to
another. The
hope is that when we branch to the next version, we should just be able to
delete the version-specific updating sections, change the main title in one
place, and be done.

[[style-literals]]
==== Literals and Text Formatting

File names and directories in text should be formatted in italics:

----
_core/modules/system/system.module_
----

Functions, variables, class names, snippets, etc. in text should be formatted
in monospace:

----
+my_function_name()+
+$foo+
----

[[style-comments]]
==== Comments

You can put comments about formatting into your AsciiDoc using double slashes,
like PHP:

----
// This is a comment that is only relevant to someone reading
// the AsciiDoc source.
----
