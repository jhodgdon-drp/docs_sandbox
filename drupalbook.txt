= The Drupal 8 API

== Introduction

This book provides information for Drupal developers on the Drupal API, and is
meant to act as a companion to the detailed class and function reference
information that you can find on https://api.drupal.org (the official Drupal API
reference site). The information here is of a tutorial and descriptive nature,
and is built from http://asciidoc.org[AsciiDoc] source files that you can find
in the "Core Docs" project on Drupal.org. (In contrast, the function/class
reference information on https://api.drupal.org is built from
specially-formatted comments embedded in the Drupal Core files themselves.)

// List individual section document files here. Try to keep them in either
// logical or alphabetical order.
